# Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ˜¸

I am **Luciano**, also well known as **Xeeynamo**. I am a **software engineer** who strongly believe in **open source** and the power of the **community**.

You will find some research and reverse engineering about commercial videogames in C#, two game engines in C++, some back-end experiments in Golang and front-end in React.

_All the projects here are hobby projects and they do not represent my skillset._
